On the third and fourth year, I took advanced courses on digital communications and signal processing, ending up with a specialization in audiovisual systems. Courses taken in the specialization included image and video processing, speech and audio processing, audiovisual content compression, acoustics and pattern recognition. I obtained the mention of excellence, granted to those students who passed all the subjects in the first attempt without failing."

Then, we compare the performance of classical one-hot embeddings against the use of previously-extracted acoustic embeddings using a problem-agnostic encoder. Our results show that the use of our embeddings increase convergence and, most important, we are able to perform a first approximation of speaker adaptation using the latent space without model fine-tuning.",
